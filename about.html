    The sun shines only on the wildflowers, sunflowers and those who care for them.
    The sun gives life to all living beings, especially the flowers as they sprout and grow,
    push through soil and turmoil,
    defy the laws of physics and react to energy, and love.
    The sun pushes away hate, dries away excess water, prevents the flowers from wilting.
    The sun is food, the sun is nourishment.
    During hard times the sun may not come out,
    in the cold of the winter like a seasonal sickness,
    the sun is only sometimes around, to warm the souls of those in need,
    but you never forget the sun, for its light and warmth is so electric.
    <span style="color: #FFBD54">    No one forgets the suns warmth.
</span>
    And in the summertime the sun may feel sharp on your skin,
    you'll be left red for days,
    from the fire of the sun.
    The suns passion and love may burn too strongly,
    it will burn the skin and brown green grass,
    deserts appear and droughts near.
    But the sting of the burn never masks the love for the sun,
    and the red fades to freckles,
    and the summer is well again.
    The sun shines only on the wildflowers, sunflowers, and those who care.
    <span style="font-size: 26px">The sun is a mother as the flowers are its children</span>, wild and untamed,
    growing from the suns love, her body producing everything the flower needs.
